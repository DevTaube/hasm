# HASM
### *(High-level ASseMbly)* 

HASM aims to be simple, but not so simple that it's hard to use. It aims to be easily extendable, and can easily be embedded into any Javascript application.

*There is no documentation for the time being. I could just say "It's not even that big, just read the source code", but to be honest? I am too lazy.*
